This README file contains information on the contents of the
meta-umobo layer.

The meta-umobo layer makes easier to use Yocto for preparing a linux image
for the U-MoBo platform (http://www.u-mobo.org).

The layer provides some customization of the Yocto standard packages in order
to workaround some issues that the author has personally faced while
preparing a Yocto image for the target system.

Actually the layer only provides an image type (named "umobo-image-qt5-eglfs")
which provide a Qt5 EGLFS-enabled system complete with fully-accelerated
QtWebkit and QtMultimedia. The layer depends on (and customizes) the
fsl-community-bsp (https://github.com/Freescale/fsl-community-bsp-platform)
and meta-qt5 (https://github.com/meta-qt5/meta-qt5) layers.

The generation of the customized linux kernel and the U-Boot for the platform
has not been integrated in meta-umobo, yet. Instead the kernel and the U-Boot
have to be compiled out-of-the-box, starting from proper repositories
(namely https://github.com/u-mobo/linux-imx and
https://github.com/u-mobo/uboot-imx, active branches).

All the layers have been tested under their respective "dizzy" branch. It
is not excluded that the layer definition works using other branches but it
has not been tested.


Step-by-step guide to image baking
=================================================

This is a step-by-step guide to reproduce the same exact image prepared
by the author (this guide only covers the preparation of the file system image,
assuming that a kernel and the U-Boot for the U-MoBo are already in place).


1) Download the REPO utils from Google (used by fsl-community-bsp)

   mkdir ~/bin

   curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo >
        ~/bin/repo

   chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

   export PATH=${PATH}:~/bin


2) Download the Freescale BSP and the Yocto system (poky), branch 'dizzy'

   mkdir ~/fsl-community-bsp

   cd ~/fsl-community-bsp

   repo init -u https://github.com/Freescale/fsl-community-bsp-platform
        -b dizzy

   repo sync


3) Download the meta-qt5 layer

   cd ~/fsl-community-bsp/sources

   git clone -b dizzy https://github.com/meta-qt5/meta-qt5.git


4) Download the meta-umobo layer

   cd ~/fsl-community-bsp/sources

   git clone -b dizzy https://github.com/morixhub/meta-umobo.git


5) Prepare your build directory

   MACHINE=imx6qsabresd source setup-environment build

   This will create a directory named "build" under your "fsl-community-bsp"
   directory. The current directory will be automatically changed to the
   new folder (MACHINE has to be replaced with proper string if
   you are using a Solo/DualLite i.MX6-based U-MoBo; the proposed string
   works fine for i.MX6 Quad).


5) Adjust your conf/bblayers.conf and conf/local.conf

   Make sure that your "conf/bblayers.conf" contains a reference to all the
   requested layers; the variable BBLAYERS should be something like:

   BBLAYERS = " \
     ${BSPDIR}/sources/poky/meta \
     ${BSPDIR}/sources/poky/meta-yocto \
     \
     ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-openembedded/meta-oe \
     ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-openembedded/meta-multimedia \
     \
     ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-fsl-arm \
     ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-fsl-arm-extra \
     ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-fsl-demos \
     \
     ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-qt5 \
     ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-openembedded/meta-ruby \
     ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-openembedded/meta-multimedia \
     \
     ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-umobo \
   "

   meta-umobo works creating a customized distribution named "umobo", so
   modify your "conf/local.conf" file in order to reference the right
   distribution; the distro variable should be set to:

   DISTRO ?= 'umobo-distro'


6) Prepare the image

   The image is "baked" issuing the command:

   bitbake umobo-image-qt5-eglfs

   Please wait... and wait again... after a few hours the filesystem
   image will be ready and packaged to
   tmp/deploy/images/imx6qsabresd/umobo-image-qt5-eglfs-imx6qsabresd.tar.bz2
   and can be deployed to SD card the usual way.


7) Prepare the Qt5 toolchain

   The Qt5 toolchain is prepared issuing the command:

   bitbake meta-toolchain-qt5

   This will produce an installer in tmp/deploy/sdk something like
   poky-glibc-x86_64-meta-toolchain-qt5-cortexa9hf-vfp-neon-toolchain-1.7.sh
   which can be used for installing the toolchain on developer machines. At
   this point QtCreator has to be properly configured in order to
   use the brand new toolchain (but this part is not covered by this guide).


8) Enjoy! :)
