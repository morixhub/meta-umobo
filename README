I. Adding the umobo layer to your build
=================================================

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the aesys layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the aesys layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-umobo \
    "
